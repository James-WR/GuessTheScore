### A soccer guess-the-score app made with Rails 6, Stimulus.js, HTML, SCSS and Bootstrap
 
Compete with friends, family and colleagues to prove you're better at predicting the weekend's exact football scores!

Create a community and invite your would-be rivals with your community's unique join code. Select the real-world league you follow (EPL, Bundesliga, La Liga etc) and make your predictions before the deadline.

Come back on Monday to check out the weekly and overall standings. You get a few points for guessing who won, but a load more for getting the score bang on!
